Q) Let's say you're deciding what to eat for breakfast. You want to make oatmeal, so you look through your pantry to see if you have oats — and you do!

public class Oatmeal 
{
  public static void main(String args[]) 
  {
      int oats = 2;

      if (oats > 0) 
      {
          System.out.println(" Let's make oatmeal today! ");
      } 
  }
}
